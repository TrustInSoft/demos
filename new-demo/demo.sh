           DETECTING UNDEFINED BEHAVIOURS MISSED BY UNIT TESTS
$H1

${GREEN}$H2
This demo demonstrates:
- How unit tests can typically miss undefined behaviors like buffer overflows
  or integer overflows if those undefined behaviors do not cause immediate
  execution problems (like a crash), and
- How TrustInSoft analysis detects them with mathematical guarantee.

We want to test a simple function increment_array() that takes an array of integers
as input and increment all its elements by one. 
$H2${RESET}
EOF

tac increment.c | sed '/increment_array(/q' | tac

press_enter $auto 20
clear

#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
cat << EOF
${GREEN}$H2
To test this function let's say that we have written 4 unit tests:
- One test with an input array of 7 small positive integers {1, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17}
- One test with a larger array of 1000 random integers
- 2 tests with corner cases with an empty array ({}) or a NULL array

sleep 1
make clean test

cat << EOF
${GREEN}$H2
As you can see all tests pass successfully. Structural coverage is 100%.

We'll see further that, despite the above good results, there are undetected
undefined behaviors (or UB further), more specifically a ${BOLD}${RED}buffer overflow${RESET}...
${GREEN}and also an ${BOLD}${RED}integer overflow

The first way to use the TrustInSoft analyzer is simply to replay the unit tests with
the analyzer. This can (this often) detects problems that remained unnoticed with unit
tests. It's convenient because if you already have unit tests, it's almost zero effort
to run the analyzer.
${RESET}
EOF

press_enter $auto 16

if [ $(which tis-analyzer) ]; then
  make tis-l1
else
  cat << EOF
You don't have the TrustInSoft Analyzer installed on this machine, but if you would,
an analysis would produce something like the below:
EOF
  cat .static/tis-l1.log
fi

cat << EOF
${GREEN}$H2
As you can see from the closing verdict, 2 undefined behaviors have been detected.
It's actually twice the same problem, found in the small and large array test
(the array size has no influence on the occurrence of the problem).
The log already contains a hint at the problem:

${RESET}increment.c:34:${MAGENTA}[kernel] warning:${RESET} out of bounds write. assert \valid(array);
${RESET}
${GREEN}If the output log is not self explanatory enough, you may want to:
- Either look at the generated HTML report, that explains the problem in a
  user friendly (but still static) way
- Or run the TrustInSoft Analyzer GUI (and use it advanced troubleshooting)
  to further  investigate the problem.
${RESET}
EOF

press_enter $auto 20
clear

cat << EOF
${GREEN}${H2}
In this case, the HTML report is enough.
If we look at the small array test it says that, at some point, the array pointer, that
iterates on the array elements, becomes invalid (not pointing to a valid memory region).
The additional information below the code tells us that the pointer is 28 bytes after
the beginning of the array. The array is 7 integers of 4 bytes, i.e. the pointer is after
the end of the array, this is a buffer overflow (or array index out of bounds).

The above information let us suppose that the loop does not stop at the right iteration,
the loop end condition is incorrect.
After looking at the code, indeed the condition should be

${YELLOW}while (len > 0)${GREEN}

instead of 

${YELLOW}while (len >= 0)${GREEN}

Because of the error, the loop runs one time too much, and the array is overflown.

Let's fix that!
${RESET}
EOF

press_enter $auto 20

sleep 0.5
sed -i "s/while (len >= 0)/while (len > 0)/" increment.c

cat << EOF
${GREEN}
Fix done! If we now rerun the Level 1 analysis, we'll see that the analyzer
will not raise any alarm.
${RESET}
EOF

press_enter $auto 5
if [ $(which tis-analyzer) ]; then
  make tis-l1
else
  cat << EOF
You don't have the TrustInSoft Analyzer installed on this machine, but if you would,
an analysis would produce something like the below:
EOF
  cat .static/tis-l1-fixed.log
fi

cat << EOF
${GREEN}$H2
The analysis now reports 0 undefined behaviors. Good!

Now that we solved all the problems found by simply re-running the unit tests
let's move to the next level: Level 2. This level consists in generalizing
function inputs so that we can detect problem that may arise from any possible
input instead of the few discrete inputs chosen in unit tests.
Instead of testing our ${YELLOW}increment_array()${GREEN} function with only 4 different arrays,
we'll test with all possible values for an array of 1000 elements.

That's 2^32^1000 possibilities or the equivalent of 4 x 10^9000 tests !
${RESET}
EOF

press_enter $auto 20
clear

cat << EOF
${GREEN}$H2
To test all possible inputs we'll write a generalized test, using TrustInSoft built-in
generalization instructions. The generalized test looks like this:
${RESET}
EOF

cat test_driver.c | tac | sed '/void *test_generalized_array()/q' | tac | sed '/^}$/q'

cat << EOF
${GREEN}$H2
The ${YELLOW}tis_make_unknown()${GREEN} instruction tells the analyzer that the ${YELLOW}input_array${GREEN}
is no longer a array with a single value for each element, but all possible values
i.e. 2^32^1000 possibilities!
This formal variable is then passed to the ${YELLOW}increment_array()${GREEN} function.

Let's run this test.
${RESET}
EOF

press_enter $auto 20

if [ $(which tis-analyzer) ]; then
  make tis-l2
else
  cat << EOF
You don't have the TrustInSoft Analyzer installed on this machine, but if you would,
an analysis would produce something like the below:
EOF
  press_enter $auto 3
  cat .static/tis-l2.log
fi

cat << EOF
${GREEN}$H2
As you can see from the above:
1. First, despite the number of inputs tested, the execution is quick (the
   mathematical core does not try one value at a time in brute force fashion)
2. Thanks to the input generalization, we have been able to detect a new Undefined Behavior.

${RESET}increment.c:32:${MAGENTA}[kernel] warning:${RESET} signed overflow. assert *array+1 â‰¤ 2147483647;
${GREEN}
Again in the current case the log may be sufficient to understand the problem our
you can look at the HTML report to get more details that will let you figure out the problem.
${RESET}
EOF

press_enter $auto 20

cat << EOF
${GREEN}$H2
In the current case, it's an integer overflow. Indeed if the array element already
contains the largest possible signed integer (2147483647), it's not possible to
increment it without causing an integer overflow whose effect is unpredictable.

The way to fix that would be, for instance, to only increment the element if it
is not already INT_MAX, the largest signed integer value.
Let's do a quick fix and then re-analyze.
${RESET}
EOF

press_enter $auto 20

sleep 0.5
sed -i -r "s/(\(\*array\) \= value \+ 1)/if \(value < INT_MAX\) \1/" increment.c

cat << EOF
${GREEN}
Fix done! Let's re-run the generalized analysis.
${RESET}
EOF

if [ $(which tis-analyzer) ]; then
  make tis-l2
else
  cat << EOF
You don't have the TrustInSoft Analyzer installed on this machine, but if you would,
an analysis would produce something like the below:
EOF
  press_enter $auto 3
  cat .static/tis-l2-fixed.log
fi

cat << EOF
${GREEN}$H2
The analyzer reports 0 Undefined Behaviors. Since we generalized all inputs we have
therefore ${YELLOW}established mathematical guarantee of absence of Undefined Behaviors
for the perimeter of analysis${GREEN} and eliminated all Undefined Behaviors that
remained unnoticed through traditional testing.
${RESET}
EOF
press_enter $auto 16
